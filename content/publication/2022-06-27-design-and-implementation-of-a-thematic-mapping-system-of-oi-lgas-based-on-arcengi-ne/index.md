## Abstract

To further enhance the level of digitization of land and resources management, timely reflect energy companiesâ€™ current management situation of its mining area, and all-round show various types of oilgas resources' exploration and exploitation achievements, this paper presents a design of the automatic mapping system of petroleum and natural gas project based on ArcGIS platform, according to the specific needs of the ministry of land and resources of petroleum and natural gas strategic research centre for automatic cartography.
Using oilgas mining blocks' spatial information,geographical base map, drawing templates and various types of attribute information from the mining right database, this system can automatically produce oilgas thematic maps.
In the running test, this system shows scientific and aesthetic mapping effect,and its operation is simple and smooth, which can fully meet the high demand of oilgas thematic mapping and improve the administrative efficiency of oilgas resources management.
