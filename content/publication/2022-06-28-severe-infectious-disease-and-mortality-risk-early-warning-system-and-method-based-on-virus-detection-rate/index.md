## Abstract

The invention relates to a severe infectious disease and mortality risk early warning system and method based on the virus detection rate.
The severe infectious disease and mortality risk early warning system comprises a risk definition module, a risk element selection module, a risk network construction module, a risk evaluation prediction module and a graded early warning module.
The severe infectious disease and mortality risk early warning system and method can effectively resolve the problems that an early warning mode based on infectious disease abnormal distribution judgment is inexact and not timely in judement, prone to generating excessive early warning and the like and can be used for complementing and optimizing an infectious disease early-stage space-time early warning mode of a domestic infectious disease monitoring automatic early warning information platform.
