intro: |
  I would like to record my study experience in this blog, including what I learned from workshops/trainings I attended, how I debugged the codes in R & Python, and other topics related to my research life. Hope this is a good way to nurture my writing habit, and push myself to write, think, and learn.
  
  I work mostly in R & RStudio, and really enjoy conducting end-to-end data analyses. Outside of work, I like playing the piano, hitting the gym, and practising Kendo.
