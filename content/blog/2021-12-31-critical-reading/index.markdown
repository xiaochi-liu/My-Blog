## What does it mean to be critical?

REASONS FOR READING CRITICALLY?
* Evaluating the usefulness of individual sources

* Building a thorough understanding of the current state of knowledge

* Identifying gaps in the research literature

* Identifying debates and alternative approaches to your topic area

* Selecting models/methods/approaches/tools for application to industry/profession

* Building & demonstrating your independence as a researcher

* Other reasons...



WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE ‘CRITICAL’ IN READING AND THINKING?
* Asking questions

* Analysing

* Evaluating

* Looking for problems or opportunities

* Comparing alternative perspectives

* Weighing the evidence

* Joining a debate

* Looking for better ways to do things

* Going beyond the surface/obvious/face value


The essential parts of thinking and reading critically
1. Understanding what is already there

## Critique is discipline-specific

Critical reading requires
1. Target (i.e. specific aspect that you critique)
    * the type of data used
    
    * the methods used to analyse data/information
    
    * theoretical models
    
    * researchers' arguments/interpretations

2. Criteria (i.e. values/measures you apply)
    * accuracy
    
    * statistical significance
    
    * real-world applicability
    
    * cost effectiveness
    
    * social justice
    

## A step-by-step model for reading critically

1. Identify key choices which have been made in the article.
    * What are some of the choices which have been made by the authors?

2. Look for alternatives to those choices (real or potential).
    * Select one or two choices
    
    * In what ways could they have been different?
    
    * What could the author/researcher have done instead?
    
    * Do you know of research where someone has taken a different approach?
    

3. Develop a point of view on those alternatives.
    * Select one choice and its alternatives
    
    * What are the strengths and weaknesses of the alternatives?
    
    * What makes the author's choice better or worse than someone else's approach?
    
    * What do you consider to be the best option?

4. Gather the evidence for your point of view.
    * Consider your point of view about the alternatives.
    
    * What are the strengths and weaknesses of the alternatives? Which is best?
    
    * What makes the author's choice better or worse than other approaches?
    
    * What kind of evidence would persuade peers in your discipline to agree with you?
    
    * Where would you find the evidence? What if you couldn't find strong evidence?
