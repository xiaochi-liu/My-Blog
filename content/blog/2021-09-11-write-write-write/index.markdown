## Prewriting

Choose the journal

Instructions to authors:

* Are there word limits? Page limits?

* Limits on the number of tables/figures?

* Do you need to provide any other sections in addition to IMRAD?

* Are there detailed instructions for each section?

* Save and refer to these instructions often!

Decide the authorship




## Drafting

Review the literature

Outline or create bullet points

Organise from general -> specific

Start writing:

* Don't wait, just write!

* **Snack writing**: write little and often

* Take the writing process one step at a time
    1. Separate into sections
    2. Leave blanks for parts you are unsure about
    3. Keep thinking of the overall purpose of the paper and its answer
    4. Keep the momentum going: your first draft is not written in stone it WILL change!
    5. Keep track of your references

Get into the writing habit through regular writing

* Establish a writing routine: make a schedule and stick to it

Having trouble putting your thoughts into sentences?

* Organise your materials (the most effective method for me)

* Imitate model articles

* Write simply

* Use sample sentence fragments

* [Write one step at a time](https://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/)

* Set deadlines
