---


Why is a detailed description of your research method necessary?

* to explain HOW you did your study

* Also to give information about WHAT, WHEN, WHO, WHY

* to enable the study to be replicated

* to provide credibility for the results


Links with other sections (connecting the content)

* with Introduction section (How do the subheadings in Method relate to the end of Introduction?)

* with Results section (How do the subheadings in Method relate to the subheadings in Result?)


## Types of Methods sections

* Condensed: assumes background knowledge

* Extended: provides full descriptions



```r
knitr::include_graphics("method types.png")
```

## Language Features

Descriptions of materials, locations, species etc

* Verb tense: Simple present


Procedural descriptions

* Verb tense: Simple past


## Methods: Style & Format

Divide into subsections with subheadings

Use combination of passive and active sentences

Avoid monotony use transition phrases

Order of presenting experimental procedures

* Chronological order

* Most to least important

Include tables/figures only if they reduce a large amount of text



## Passive Voice

Advice often given to avoid passive

* be more direct & less wordy

* Avoid very long subjects and a passive verb at the end of the sentence

    > Wheat and barley, collected from the Virginia field site, as well as sorghum and millet, collected at Loxton
were used.

* Place subject and verb within the first 9 words of the sentence

* Place any list of items at the end of the sentence

    > Four cereals were used: wheat and barley, collected from the Virginia field site; and sorghum and millet, collected at Loxton.


Use passive

* when the identity of the agent (experimenter) is less important than the action (experiment)

  > We drew blood samples.

  > Blood samples were drawn.

* for variety (when the same agent is carrying out all the actions)

* for modesty

* by convention (e.g., first person pronouns I, my, me are rare in scientific papers)

* to improve cohesion and coherence: information flow (Old -> New information)


Use both Passive and Active Sentences
