summary: How to write Discussion section
---


The main function of the Discussion section is:

* to answer the question(s) posed in the Introduction

The discussion section will also

* explain how the specific results support the answers

* show how the answers relate to what is already known

* suggest future research directions

It is not a recap. There needs to be added value to the reader.


How should we start?

* Interpret and support key findings: answer the question that you posed in the Introduction and highlight evidence

* If desired, restate study purpose or provide brief context first (> 2 sentences)


## Organization of the Discussion

## Content (information elements)

1. Review of the purpose of the study: activity, research questions, hypotheses

2. Review of findings (most -> least significant)

    * compared to your expectations
    
    * compared to others' findings

3. Explanations and/or speculations on findings

4. Limitations of the study

5. Implications of your research (generalisations)

6. Recommendations for future research & applications of your research



## Two main components

1. State and interpret your key findings (Answer your research question)

    * Interpret key findings & conclude based on your findings and the literature
    
    * Explain how you reached the conclusions: compare/contrast with the literature
    
    * Give the paper significance by generalizing the results
    
    * Indicate clearly how you have advanced knowledge

2. Summarize and generalize (What is new and why your results are important)

    * Include explanations any results that don’t support your answers
    
    * Discuss other results and relevant hypotheses
    
    * Discuss possible errors/limitations
    
    * Provide explanations of unexpected findings
    
    * Suggest next steps



## Drafting

Linking Introduction & Discussion


Comparing/contrasting your findings with others

> This finding is consistent with that of Smith (2000) who ...

> In accordance with the present results, previous studies have demonstrated that ...

> These results support previous research into this brain area which links X and Y.

> In contrast to earlier findings, however, no evidence of X was detected.

> This study has been unable to demonstrate that ...

> This discrepancy could be attributed to ...

> There are two likely causes for the differences between ...


Providing closure: write a one paragraph conclusion that summarizes your interpretations

* Interpretation of key results (the answer)

* Significance of the work

    * Try to generalize to broader situations
    
    * Practical application
    
    * Theoretical proposition
    

## Language features

Need to pay attention to _verb_ choice

* Attitude to findings

* Strength of claim


A very common structure in Discussions:

* **main clause** (with projecting verb) + **that clause** (with another verb)

> These results _suggest_ that the test material _is_ more rigid.

> Our results _demonstrate_ that X _regulates_ Y.

> It _appears_ that X _has_ Y.

> The presence of X _suggests_ that Y _may be stabilised_ by Z.


Two opportunities to indicate the strength of your claim

1. Main verb (choice of verb, tense of verb)

    > The results _indicate/establish_ that there is a link ...

    > Table 9 _suggests/shows_ a greater response when ...

    > The latest data _question/challenge_ the conclusions of ...

    > The results _validate/support_ the hypothesis that ...

    > The test results _create/suggest_ a basis for ...

    > Changes in X may have _influenced/distorted_ the ...

    > Figure 12 _depicts/clarifies_ the relationship between ...

2. Verb in that clause (tense, use of modal or not)

    * Tense of Verb in the _that_ clause
    
        * Simple past tense: applies to your study only
        
            > It is possible that microbial activity caused some immobilization of labial soil phosphorous.
        
        * Simple present tense: general condition
        
            > It is possible that microbial activity causes some immobilization of labial soil phosphorous.
            
        * It is also possible to substitute the that clause with a Noun Phrase
        
            > Previous studies have demonstrated that there was a positive relationship between propagule pressure and the establishment success of non native species.


Express probability by using

* modal auxiliary verbs, e.g. may, can, could

* adjectives, e.g. possible, likely, uncertain

* nouns, e.g. possibility, suggestion


Distance yourself from the claim by

* using impersonal constructions

    > appears to/seems that...
    
    > it has been said that...
    
    > it is believed...

* attributing the belief to others

    > in the view of some expert...
    
    > many researchers hold that...
    

Weaken generalisations by:

* using the verb **tend**

* qualifying the subject, e.g. most, many, a majority of, certain types of, nearly all

* mentioning the evidence, e.g. According to this preliminary study; Based on the limited data available

* adding exceptions, e.g. With the exception of...; Apart from...; Except for...

* using a weaker verb, e.g.

    > leads -> contributes
    
    > causes -> is associated with
    
    > proves -> suggests










## Common problems

* The answer/ interpretation of key findings is not provided in the first paragraph

* No concluding paragraph is provided

* The importance/ significance of the study is not clear

* Results are repeated or summarised in the discussion section

* Often too long and verbose or too short and underdeveloped


## Other considerations

Give credit where it is deserved

* Methods/results from other studies added important elements to your study design

* Your work supports/improves upon work of others

Be transparent about unexpected/results that disagree with others

* Explain the differences, don’t pretend they don’t exist

Acknowledge limitations/alternative explanations of your findings

* Pre-empts a reviewer’s opportunity to point them out


## Final check

Remember that you need to ensure that your Discussion connects clearly with the issues you raised
in your Introduction, especially the country where you began , your research niche, and your statement of purpose or main activity.

When the first draft of the Discussion is ready, go back to the Introduction and check for a close fit.

If necessary, redraft the Introduction to make sure the issues of importance in the Discussion appear there also.
