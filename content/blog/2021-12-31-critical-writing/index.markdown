## Introduction

Why is critical writing valuable?
* necessary to identify a gap for your own original research

* important to judge the usefulness of research to industry/professional applications

* demonstrates deeper understanding, respect for previous work + independent stance

* draws on discipline specific norms and knowledge

* shows arguably the highest level of academic writing


What is critical writing?
* Evaluating previous research

* Identifying debates / alternative approaches

* Examining and questioning evidence

* Weighing strengths and weaknesses

* Assessing the current state of knowledge

* Asking probing questions

* Looking for opportunities to contribute

## The structure of critical writing


Your critical claim (i.e., the view you express about the target) can have two parts:
* **Evaluation (either explicit or implicit)** -- essential

* *Proposal* -- optional

> While previous descriptive research has provided an overview of patient-carer dynamics, **it has not examined which of these impact on engagement with telehealth**.
_Exploratory research would be useful, to investigate the role these relationships play, in supporting or discouraging the uptake of telehealth_.

Sometimes the evaluation and proposal are folded in together:

> While previous descriptive research has provided an overview of patient-carer dynamics, _exploratory research would be **more useful** at this stage, to shed light on the role that these interactions play, in supporting or discouraging the uptake of telehealth_.




So **the basic structure** is:
1. Summary of the target (i.e., other person's/group's choice that you are critiquing)

2. Your claim
    * Evaluation
    
    * Proposal (optional)

3. Evidence for your claim


Your discipline shapes your critique
* The kind and amount of evidence

* How strong the claims should be

* The amount of critique expected

* The targets for critique

* The criteria for critique

## Handy bits

Evaluation:
* Concession: while, whereas, although, despite
    
* Endorsement: claims, states, points out, shows
    
* Modality: could, may, possibility, appears to be
    
* Value laden language: convincing, useful, apt
    
* Grading: somewhat, slightly, in some cases


Step-by-step:
1. Summarise the target (e.g. the sample, the analysis, the research questions)
    
2. Evaluate the target, according to the criteria (e.g. reliability, insight, equity)
    
3. Note the evidence which supports your evaluation
