## Giving Feedback

Bad Feedback
* Criticise the writer, rather than the writing

* Use a superior tone of voice

* Use words like “you need to” and “you should”

* Deliver the feedback as “fact”

* Be vague, general, negative, and leave the writer with nowhere to go -- "this chapter is not good enough"

* Be vague, general, positive, and leave the writer with nowhere to go –– "it’s fine"

* Assume you have no “legitimacy” to give feedback –– “I don’t know enough about your work to comment”

* Assume the writer is dependent on your feedback

* Pedantically pick on every small grammatical error


Effective Feedback
* Criticises the writing, not the writer

* Avoids phrases like “you need to” or “you should”

* Is offered as a point of view

* Is specific, concrete, constructive and offers alternatives and solutions

* Involves both negative and positive points

* Appreciates that the writer will weigh up the comments and make up their own mind

* **Provides corrections for the first few minor errors and leaves the writer to correct the rest**

* Focuses upon substantive issues in the writing

* Offers solutions or alternatives as suggestions

* Provide constructive criticism & positive comments

* Share neutral comments
    - General reactions
    
    - First impressions
    
    - Thoughts about how the draft has changed from a previous draft

    - Areas of agreement and disagreement with other feedback and your reasons for this

* Not just about pointing out what is wrong with the writing
    - Also provide positive feedback
    
    - builds confidence

    - provides encouragement

    - helps the writer to see what they did right, so they don’t change it

    - helps other group members to identify and model good examples
