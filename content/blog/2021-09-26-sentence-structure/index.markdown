## Express the core of the message in the subject, verb, and completer

Sentences tell us
* who is the sentence about

* what did they do

### Make the topic the subject of the sentence

The topic is what the sentence is talking about

> **The children** had diabetes mellitus.

> **The children** with arteriovenous shunts *had* the shunts opened, heparin injected, and the arterial and venous sides of the shunt clamped. 💩
>
> In the children who had arteriovenous shunts, **the shunts** *were opened*, **heparin** *was injected*, and **the arterial and venous sides of the shunt** *were clamped*. 👍


### Put the action in the verb

The action is what the topic is doing / being done to it

> We performed an analysis on the data. 💩
>
> We *analysed* the data. 👍


Verbs are action words: describe motion (e.g., explore, examine, observe)

Verbs can be turned into noun

| verb           | noun          |
|----------------|---------------|
| to regulate    | regulation    |
| to occur       | occurrence    |
| to understand  | understanding |
| to investigate | investigation |
| to complete    | completion    |

* Readers expect the main action of a clause to be found in the verb

* Many nouns that express action are made by addition of a noun ending to a verb

* Another verb must be added
    - vague & don't express action
    
    - occurred, was seen, was noted, was observed, caused, produced
    
      > An increase in heart rate occurred.
      >
      > Heart rate _increased_.

      > The new drug caused a decrease in heart rate.
      >
      > The new drug _decreased_ heart rate.

      > With leg vessel congestion, the compliance of forearm vessels increased significantly.
      >
      > When leg vessels _were congested_, the compliance of forearm vessels increased significantly.

Avoid starting with "there is"

> There is inhibition of the immune system.
>
> The immune system is inhibited

Sentences are easier to read when the ratio of **Verbs:Nouns** is higher

> An **increase** in **heart rate** _occurred_. (1:2)
>
> **Heart rate** _increased_. (1:1)

> The new **drug** _caused_ a **decrease** in **heart rate**. (1:3)
>
> The new **drug** _decreased_ **heart rate**. (1:2)


Verbs in noun form can sometime be useful (**increase cohesion**)
* can summarize the action of the previous sentence

* form a backward link to something familiar (increase cohesion)



Action in the verb examples:

> They had resolution of their arthritis.
>
> Their arthritis resolved.

> We made at least two analyses on each specimen.
>
> We analysed each specimen at least twice.

> The patient showed no change in symptoms.
>
> The patient's symptoms did not change.
>
> The patient's symptoms were unchanged.

> A progressive decrease in death rate occurred.
>
> The death rate progressively decreased.
>
> The death rate decreased progressively.

> The database has been subject to different improvements.
>
> The database has been improved.






## Keep subjects near verbs

Reader looks for two primary piece of information
* Who is the sentence about?

* What are they doing?

Confuses reader if far part.
Reader will need to re read the sentence

> Farmers that understand the difference between the soil requirements of plants when they are seedlings and their requirements when they are mature *are* in high demand. 💩
>
>Farmers *are* in high demand if they understand the difference between the soil requirements of plants when they are seedlings and their requirements when they are mature. 👍


> *One study* of 930 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving care in one of two managed care settings or in a fee for service setting *found that* only two thirds of those needing to contact a neurologist for an MS related problem in the prior 6 months had done so (Vickrey et al 1999). 💩
>
> *One study found that*, of 930 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) who were receiving care in one of two managed care settings or in a fee for service setting, only two thirds of those needing to contact a neurologist for an MS related problem in the prior six months had done so (Vickrey et al 1999). 👍





Give the context before you write a list

> Peanuts, shrimp, almonds, milk or anything else with lactose, and wheat or anything with gluten all represent things that *people are commonly allergic to*. 💩
>
> *People are commonly allergic* to peanuts, shrimp ... 👍




## Avoid noun clusters

> blood flow, protein metabolism, lung function, filament length variability

Noun clusters dilute the meaning

Long noun clusters bring imprecision into sentences

> Solar One is a 10 megawatt solar thermal electric central receiver Barstow power pilot plant.
>
> Solar One is a solar powered pilot plant located near Barstow.
>
> Solar One produces 10 megawatts of electric power by capturing solar energy in a central receiver design.


To untangle noun clusters:
* start at the end

* work to the beginning

* adding prepositions

> filament length variability
>
> variability of the length of the filaments
>
> variability of filament length



To untangle adjectives and noun clusters:
* start at the end

* work to the beginning

* adding prepositions

* place adjective in front of appropriate noun

* only one noun should be placed after the adjective

> Chronic sheep experiments
>
> Chronic experiments in sheep


> Peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation
>
> Stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors

Revised version is longer than original version - clarity, not brevity

Treat noun clusters like abbreviations
* Avoid if possible.








## Write short sentences

Short sentences are easier to understand
* Don't pack too many ideas into one sentence

* Don't string ideas together

* Don't talk about more than one thing at a time

Mean sentence length < 22 words
* Balance longer sentences by writing a short sentence

* Short sentences have strong impact

* Important ideas in the short sentence

Sentences vary in length
* Short sentences:
    - introducing a new subject
    
    - making an impact
    
    - striking conclusion

* Long sentences:
    - developing a point







## Use clear pronouns

A word that replaces and refers to a noun
* it, he, she, they, these, those, them, this, that, which, both

> We use these **conditions** because **they** allow us to measure the ….

The noun that the pronoun refers to needs to be clear

> Research on **these diseases** is hampered because laboratory animals are not susceptible to **them**.


Avoid having an unsupported "this"
* This/these + a summary phrase (unattended this common in spoken and informal writing)

* Avoids ambiguity

* Is an empowering device (allows writer to interpret the prior information)







## Put parallel ideas in parallel form

Parallel ideas
* Ideas that are equal in logic and importance

* Joined by **and**, **or**, **but**

* Comparisons


Use same grammatical structure
* Clauses (subject, verb, completer)

* Prepositional phrases (of, in, for)

* Infinitive phrases (to determine, to identify)



Readers can concentrate all their attention on the relation of the ideas
* similarity

* alternatives

* contrast

* comparison


> Cardiac output decreased by 40% but there was only a 10% decrease in blood pressure. 💩 
>
> Cardiac output (subject) decreased (verb) by 40% (completer) but blood pressure (subject) decreased (verb) by only 10% (completer). 👍


> We hoped to increase the complete response and improve survival.
>
> We hoped _to increase_ the complete response and _to improve_ survival.


> This lack of response _could have been due to_ damage of a cell surface receptor by the isolation procedure, but it _could also be that_ isolated cells do not respond normally because the cells are isolated.
>
> This lack of response _could have been due to_ damage of a cell surface receptor by the isolation procedure, but it _could also have been due to_ isolated cells not responding normally because they are isolated.




Overuse of "compared to"
* when writing **higher**, **greater**, **less**, afterwards write **than** (not compared to)

  > We found a higher number of bacteria at 37° than at 25°

* "Compared to" should not be used with "decreased" or "increased" because the meaning is ambiguous.

  > The experimental wheel had a 28% decrease in turning resistance compared to the current standard wheel on indoor surfaces.

  - Did turning resistance decrease (A) in both the experimental and standard wheel? (B) only in the experimental wheel? (C) in neither type?

  > The experimental wheel *had a 28% greater decrease* in turning resistance *than did* the current standard wheel.
  >
  > The experimental wheel *had a 28% decrease* in turning resistance but the current standard wheel *had no decrease*.
  >
  > The experimental wheel *had a 28% lower* turning resistance *than did* the current standard wheel.


Problems with Comparisons
* Overuse of "compared to"

* Comparing unlike things. Don't try to compare apples and pears

  > These results are similar to those of previous studies.

* Absolute statements disguised as comparisons

  > In this medium, the concentration of phosphate (4-5 mM) is about half that in Schneider's medium (9-10mM).

Examples

> Even the highest dose of atropine had no effect *either on* the baseline pulse rate *or on* the vagally stimulated pulse rate.

> Cardiac output was *less in* the E.coli group *than in* the Pseudomonas group.

> The tubes were _spun on a Vortex mixer for 10s_, _stored at 4° for 2h_, and then they were _centrifuged at 500g for 10 min_.

> An impulse from the vagus nerve to the muscle has to travel _both through_ ganglia _and though_ post-ganglionic pathways.

> Left ventricular function was impaired _in_ the dogs that received endotoxin but not _in_ the control dogs.

> The mechanical response of heart muscles depends _both on_ the absolute osmolal increase _and on_ the species studied.
