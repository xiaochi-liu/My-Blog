summary: How to write Introduction section

The introduction is an argument. It needs to persuade your reader that:

* The research area is important, relevant and interesting

* Your study is necessary and unique (and timely)

* Your paper is worth publishing/reading in full


## Problem / Solution


```r

```r
knitr::include_graphics("introduction shape 2.png")
```

```r
knitr::include_graphics("introduction shape 3.png")
```

```r
knitr::include_graphics("introduction shape 4.png")
```

## Drafting Process

1. Write an aim statement for your intro (move 3.1)

    > We hypothesized that...
    
    > We tested the hypothesis that...
    
    > We asked whether...
    
    > To answer this question,....
    
    > This prompted us to investigate whether...
    
    > To resolve this apparent difference...
    
    > We solved this problem by...
    
    > The purpose of our study was...


2. Identify the gap or need for further work (move 2)

    > There has been no research to date on...
    
    > The question still remains whether...
    
    > However, little research has been conducted on...
    
    > Few studies have investigated...
    
    > Previous studies have failed to...
    
    > But, Although, However, Despite, While
    
    * Counter claiming (something is wrong)
    
        > Recent advances, however, indicate the methods used for analysing the samples are flawed.
    
    * Indicating a gap (something is missing)
    
        > Recent advances, however, indicate the methods used for analysing the samples are flawed.
    
    * Raising a question of making an inference (something is unclear)
    
        > These findings suggest that the spatial distribution of rocks might affect the surface heat flow.
    
    * Continuing a tradition (adding something)
    
        > It would therefore be interesting to extend these studies to purified vesicular preparations.
        

3. Draft the setting. Think about the intended audience and their interests and background knowledge (move 1)

    * Provide general background to your area

    * Sentence 1 is often an obvious, generally accepted statement about the area in which you are working. (A definition of a key term can work.)

    * The text then moves the reader closer to your specific topic, i.e. from **General** to **Specific**.
    

4. Arrange information from the literature (move 1.3)

    * Locating your study in the field
    
    * To move closer to your area, you can introduce and review more specific aspects of the area that have already been studied by others.
    
    * You need to determine how you will organise these “more specific aspects”
    
        1. Studies most distantly related to yours -> Studies most closely related to yours
        
        2. Chronological order
        
        3. Different approaches to the research problem (group the papers/method, focus, etc..!)


5. Combine stages to form complete introduction

    * Add/rearrange sentences for logical development and flow
    
    * It is common to establish niches as you describe previous research (move 1.3), rather than to review all the literature and then point out the gaps that need filling.
    
    * It is more persuasive to ‘build the gap’ by describing the contributions and limitations of previous research, than by simply stating that your research fills a gap (eg "This research is motivated by the gap in the literature")
    
    * Improving flow
    
        * Informative topic sentences
        
        * Progress from old > new information: Start text with some familiar information; Following sentence, repeat some information from the previous sentence
        
        * Repeat key terms
        
        * Keep a consistent order: If you list 2 or more items in the topic sentence, describe/explain them in the same order
        
        * Use this + summary/category term: this reduction, this improvement, this theory, this situation
        
    
    * Verb tense
    
        * Present tense: When citing others’ work to establish the importance of your work; To talk about general background information
        
            > This functional group has roles in coordination chemistry.
        
        * Present perfect tense: When citing others’ work that is still believed to be true
        
            > This functional group has been shown to have roles in coordination chemistry.
            
    * Citation styles
    
        1. According to Kim (2004), bilbies do not eat apples.
        
        2. Several researchers have demonstrated that bilbies have a fondness for chocolate (ref).
        
        3. Bilbies have a fondness for chocolate (ref).

## Final thoughts

They are shorter than you probably think!

* Typically 3 paragraphs long

* Recommended range: 2-5 paragraphs

Some information -> discussion section

* Avoid unnecessary overlap between introduction and discussion sections
