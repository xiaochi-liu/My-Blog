Figures

* Visual impact

* Show trends and patterns

* Tell a quick story

* Tell the whole story

* Highlight a particular result

Tables

* Give precise values

* Display many values/variables


## Organization of Results

Chronological: Order with subheadings that parallel the methods

Grouping by topic or experiment

General to specific

Most to least important


## Text

Break into subsections, with headings (if needed)

The text should not merely repeat or describe what is in the visual, but should _**highlight**_ important points.

The text in the results make explicit the message(s) suggested by the data in the visuals.


Complement the information that is already in tables and figures

* Give precise values that are not available in the figure

* Report the percent change or percentage difference if absolute values are given in the table


Avoid simply repeating the numbers that are already available in tables and figures

* Repeat / highlight only the most important numbers



Summarize what the data show:

* Point out simple relationships
    
* Describe big picture trends

* Cite figures or tables that present supporting data

  > Measurements of root length density (Figure 3) **revealed** that the majority of roots of both cultivars **were** found in the upper substrate layers.

  > The response of lucerne root growth to manganese rate and depth treatments **was** similar to that of shoots (Figure 2).

  > Figure 17 **shows** the average number of visits per bird.


Don’t forget to talk about negative and control results


Reserve information about what you did for the methods section

* In particular, do not discuss the rationale for statistical analyses within the Results section


Reserve comments on the meaning of your results for the discussion section





## Verb Tense

Past tense (active or passive)

* When sentence focuses on the completed study (What was done and found)

    > We found that...
    
    > Women were more likely to...
    
    > Men smoked more cigarettes than...
    
    > The average reaction time was...
    
Present tense

* To describe an “always true” situation

* When the sentence focuses on the document, which will always be there

    > The effect of urea concentration on the fed leaf and shoot growth in subterranean clover **is** summarised in Table 1.
    
    > Figure 1 shows...
    
    > The data suggest...
    
    > The findings confirm...
    
    > We believe that this shows...


Modal verbs (may, could)

* May be used in comments
    

## Data ≠ Results

Data: facts & numbers (tables and figures)

> In the 20 control subjects, the mean resting blood pressure was 85 ± 5 (SD) mmHg. In comparison, in the 30 tennis players, the mean resting blood pressure was 94 ± 3 mmHg.

Results: text that summarizes or explains what the data show (main text)

* What do these data say?

* What do these data mean in their context?

> The mean resting blood pressure **was higher** in the 30 tennis players than in the 30 control subjects [94 ± 3 (SD) vs. 85 ± 5 mmHg, P < 0.02].

> The mean resting blood pressure **was 10 % higher** in the 30 tennis players than in the 20 control subjects [94 ± 3 (SD) vs. 85 ± 5 mmHg, P < 0.02].
